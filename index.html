    Thank you to everyone for your responses. There was an <a href="http://i.imgur.com/80WmdkR.jpg">overwhelming</a> amount of people who want OneeChan to return.
    <br><br>
    Messing with the script to get it up to par, however, I find I really don't recognize the project for the most part. I've lost the inspiration to continue with it, and instead would rather focus my energy on new things. OneeChan has given many, many options and changes back to other scripts, and it's been a great test bed, but it's simply not mine anymore.
    <br><br>
    Should anyone else wish to continue with it, the code will always be here on Github under the GNU Public License.
    <br><br>
    I hope other things I make in the future can be as fun and inspirational and community-based as OneeChan was. Thank you, everyone!
